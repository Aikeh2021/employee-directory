# Employee Directory

There's nothing more helpful than having a directory of your employees' information complete with a picture of each of their smiling faces! One of the great things about the Employee Directory is that you have access to a sortable table that allows you to view all the informaiton about your staff in a neat and easy to follow website. 
To view more information about how to use this application, view the installation instructions below.

## Installation

To view the github repository for this website [click here](https://github.com/Aikeh2021/employee-directory). Git clone the SSH key and customize the users information to contain an array of objects with the information of the employees you would like to display. Feel free to alter the information available on the chart to better match your needs. For example, instead of date of birth, you may be interested in dispalying an office number, or a staff member's specific area of expertise.
Otherwise, to view the deployed website and test its functionality, [click here](https://aikeh2021.github.io/employee-directory/).

## Usage

The usability of this website is rather initutive. If you would like to find an employee by a department phone number, use the search bar located above the table to search the digits of an employee's phone. If you would like to order the employee's table by name, click the "Name" column head on the table. The first click will sort the staff by A-to-Z. A second click will sort the saff from Z-to-A.
